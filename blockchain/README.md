<h3 align="center">SoloCoin</h3>

Angular application that allows you to interact with a blockchain. You can see the blocks on chain, see transaction within them and even create new transactions and mine blocks.

Built on top of [SavjeeCoin](https://github.com/Savjee/SavjeeCoin) (simply Blockchain implementation in Javascript).

*⚠️This is for educational purposes only. This is by no means a complete blockchain implementation (nor does it aim to be one). Use it to learn how blockchains operate.*
